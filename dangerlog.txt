1.After server finishes working and quits, the client will not quit. We need to manually press ctrl-C to quit the client side. The reason is that in order to saturate server, we wrap the connection of client to server inside a while loop. In that case, even the server stops working, client threads will keep trying to connect.\
2.We could have only locked one bucket when operating on it, which can reduce the blocking time, compared with locking whole vector. Such a decrement would improve performance.\
3.When using the variable \'93reqCount\'94 to count the number of request from client, we used a lock to avoid race condition. However, we could also use atomic operation to increase this variable, which will reduce the overhead caused by mutex lock.\
4.When dealing with the vector that represent buckets, we passed a reference of vector instead of passing a copy. Such operation can reduce the overhead, compared with dealer the vector as a global variable.\
5.We can also improve our code by using smarter pointer or lck_guard, which comply to RAII.\
